The SELinux Game presents different scenarios, each with a problem that is
SELinux related. These scenarios simulate a sysadmin being called to look into
a situation they canâ€™t predict. The goal of the player is to demonstrate
SELinux skills by solving each scenario. Some of the exercises simulate an
intruder on your system, so knowing when to fix the AVC denial and when to
recognize that they are protecting you is part of it. The scenarios are run
locally using Vagrant, which makes it easy to run.
