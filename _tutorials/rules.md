The primary security mechanism of SELinux is type enforcement, meaning that
rules are specified using the type of the process and object:

```
allow user_t user_home_t:file { create read write unlink };
```

This rule states that the _user_t_ type is allowed to create, read, write,
and delete files with the user_home_t type.

A groups of rules together make a policy, which collectively allow all of the
necessary permissions a given application needs. List all of the installed
policies with the `semodule -l` command.
