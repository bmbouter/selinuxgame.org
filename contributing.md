SELinux is volunteer run and values several types of contributions from the
community. Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

## Become an Admin

Admins verify solutions from other users over IRC. Admins also update the
records for users who provide correct solutions.

## Contribute a Scenario

Have an SELinux puzzle you think others would enjoy? Read the [scenario
contributing guide](https://github.com/SELinuxGame/scenario_template)to see
how easy contributing is. A scenario template is provided which makes it easy
to get started.

## Promote It

Host an SELinux Game meetup, whereby a group of players all play the game
together. It's good to ensure an Admin is online.
