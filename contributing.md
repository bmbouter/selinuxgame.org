SELinux is volunteer run and benefits from several types of contributions from
the community.

## Become an Admin

Admins verify solutions from other users over IRC. Admins also update the
records for users who provide correct solutions.

## Contribute a Scenario

The scenarios primarily come out of everyday experiences with SELinux. We are
looking for new scenarios to be contributed. We are hoping to write a scenario
contributing guide soon.

## Tell Others

The SELinux game is intended to allow more people to understand SELinux, which
helps make many environment more secure.
